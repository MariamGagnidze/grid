          I received a job offer mid-course,<br />
          and the subjects I learned were <br />
          current, if not more so, in the <br />
          company I joined. I honestly feel I <br />

          “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the <br />
          bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition <br />
          and have heard some people who had an <br />
          amazing experience here. I signed up for the <br />
          free intro course and found it incredibly fun! <br />
          I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks <br />
          was the best - and most grueling - time of my <br />
          life. Since completing the course, I’ve <br />
          successfully switched careers, working as a <br />
          Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

          “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a <br />
          line of code. I needed some structure from <br />
          professionals who can help me learn programming <br />
          step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former <br />
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things <br />
          about the program. The entire curriculum and staff <br />
          did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I <br />
          never had to wait long for assistance. The agile <br />
          team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took <br />
          my learning to the next level in a way that no <br />
          tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred <br />
          to it during interviews as an example of my <br />
          developent experience. It certainly helped me land <br />
          a job as a full-stack developer after receiving <br />
          multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
